# Pathfinding Visualized
A simple tool for visualizing pathfinding algorithms on a 2D grid. 
Made with OpenGL. Based on [Game AI Pro](http://www.gameaipro.com/).

## Jump Point Search
An extension of A* that should be a magnitude faster through node-pruning.

## Goal Bounding
Goal bounding is a pathfinding optimization technique that can speed up A* by roughly 
eight times on a grid, however, it is applicable to any graph search space, including 
waypoint graphs and navmeshes.
