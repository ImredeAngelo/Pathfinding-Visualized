## Pathfinding-Visualized
Project for testing A* vs Jump Point Search (JPS) and Goal-Bounding. 
Using OpenGL. Only tested on windows 10.

# Jump Point Search
An extension of A* that should be a magnitude faster through node-pruning.

# Goal-Bounding
Pre-process a table. Calculations take a long time!
